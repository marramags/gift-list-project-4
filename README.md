## App Features (description)
This app allows users to organize and plan out their holiday shopping. Most holiday apps focus on wishlists to share with others. The Gifting List prioritizes simple and  easy functionality to keep track of who's on the user's shopping list and the purchased status. This app was born to keep the true holiday spirit and hopefully alleviates some holiday stress.

## Wins:

##### *TECHNICAL GROWTH*
After the past 12 weeks of the bootcamp, I can certainly feel and see the growth from where I started on Day One. I know I have a lot more to learn but my confidence and comfortability (or even lack of comfortability) is developing each day. The MERN stack is quite complex to me and I am surprised at how I was able to follow along and utilize the basics from the past units to complete this project.

##### *COLLABORATION & COMMUNICATION*
Although this was a solo project, I didn't feel like I was on my own during the process. My cohort members and I collaborated everyday trying to: fix each other's bugs, share ideas, share thought processes, lift each other up, and celebrate the wins. This was a highlight of the project. I now see and understand how collaborative this work and industry is and I look forward to learn and practice these skills throughout my journey.

##### *PERSONAL GROWTH*
This project has tested every part of my being and yet I somehow managed to summon the energy, courage, and patience to continue. I overcame mental doubts like imposter syndrome and am truly opening myself up to this learning journey. I'm also learning that I don't have to go through this alone. I challenged myself put my pride aside and reach out for help or guidance. Through those interactions, I am learning that it is okay to not know everything, people are willing to help, and more benefits come out of it than I realized. From the wise words of Moira Rose: “When one of us shines, all of us shine.” I know where I am at and I know where I should go to only get better.

## Challenges:
This project came with a handful of challenges and I was able to overcome several. One in particular is time management, organizing my thoughts, and knowing how to use available resources. 

##### *FLOW*
The MERN stack is still a maze to me. I drew out my app's flow, which I had to refer often, and I also needed to make sure it made sense. Each layer of the components and pages added an extra challenge but I focused on making sure it made sense before moving forward.

##### *UPDATE (CRUD)*
The PUT method in CRUD has been and is still a challenge. For this project, I decided change the gift item status from false: unpurchased to true: purchased. I assumed checkboxes would be simple enough to create, however the big challenge was getting the data to push into the backend and vice versa to the frontend. I was luckily able to collaborate with a cohort member and the instructors and were able to figure it out.

##### *STYLING*
I enjoy a sleek and beautiful aesthetic and I had plans to make this app into something beautiful. The challenge for me was finding content and a theme that I could incorporate with my skills and in the time I had. I also ran into hurdles like styling/centering my links in the navigation bar. However, with lots of experimentation and research I was able to achieve a fun holiday look and feel that I am proud of.

##### *BUGS*
Some bugs and errors I ran into were cryptic and some took me a bit of time to figure out. Thankfully, I have learned to have more patience when experiencing bugs and I had a great support group within my cohort to share ideas and possible solutions to fixing errors. As I progessed throughout the projects, I learned how to read errors quickly and pinpoint why the application was "unhappy." 

## Shout Outs!
I want to thank the entire cohort and the instructors for all the help, guidance, brainstorming sessions, and overall amazing company throughout this experience. A big shout out to Emily for helping me get the checkboxes working. A big shout out to the instructors for their encouragement, guidance, and belief in me that I can push on through. A big shout out to Ann for being my cheerleader and igniting my fighting spirit. Lastly, a big shout out to the entire cohort for keeping it real, sharing laughs, going through the motions, showing support, and just making this pivot one I will always remember.
