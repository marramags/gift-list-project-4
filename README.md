# The Gifting List

## App Features (description)
This app allows users to organize and plan out their holiday shopping. Most holiday apps focus on wishlists to share with others. The Gifting List prioritizes simple and  easy functionality to keep track of who's on the user's shopping list and the purchased status. This app was born to keep the true holiday spirit and hopefully alleviates some holiday stress.

## Challenges:
This project came with a handful of challenges and I was able to overcome several. One in particular is time management, organizing my thoughts, and knowing how to use available resources. 

##### *FLOW*
The MERN stack is still a maze to me. I drew out my app's flow, which I had to refer often, and I also needed to make sure it made sense. Each layer of the components and pages added an extra challenge but I focused on making sure it made sense before moving forward.

##### *UPDATE (CRUD)*
The PUT method in CRUD has been and is still a challenge. For this project, I decided change the gift item status from false: unpurchased to true: purchased. I assumed checkboxes would be simple enough to create, however the big challenge was getting the data to push into the backend and vice versa to the frontend. I was luckily able to collaborate with a cohort member and the instructors and were able to figure it out.

##### *STYLING*
I enjoy a sleek and beautiful aesthetic and I had plans to make this app into something beautiful. The challenge for me was finding content and a theme that I could incorporate with my skills and in the time I had. I also ran into hurdles like styling/centering my links in the navigation bar. However, with lots of experimentation and research I was able to achieve a fun holiday look and feel that I am proud of.

##### *BUGS*
Some bugs and errors I ran into were cryptic and some took me a bit of time to figure out. Thankfully, I have learned to have more patience when experiencing bugs and I had a great support group within my cohort to share ideas and possible solutions to fixing errors. As I progessed throughout the projects, I learned how to read errors quickly and pinpoint why the application was "unhappy."
